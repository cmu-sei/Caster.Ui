# CasterUi Readme

Caster is the primary deployment component of the Crucible framework. Caster is built upon Terraform, an open source "Infrastructure as Code" tool. Caster provides a web interface that gives exercise developers a way to create, share, and manage topology configurations.

For more information on native Terraform constructs used in Caster, please refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).
